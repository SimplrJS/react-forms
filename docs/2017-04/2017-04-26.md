### State of mind

:tada: :clap: :tada: :clap: :tada: :clap: :tada: :clap: :tada: :clap: :tada: :clap: 

### Sooooo... What happened?

After quite a bit of work, a first e2e workflow now forks. Non-test, but a working browser example! 

### So... How does it look?

Technical. No styles, no nothing, just two text fields and a form. And you can submit the form (this one is big for the library :smile:).

### And if we spoke code?

Right. So the exciting part is that everything works as planned:

A declarative and intuitive way to build forms.

The whole react application including the form looks like this:
```ts
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "tslib";
import { FormStore } from "simplr-forms-core/stores";
import { Form, Text, Submit } from "simplr-forms-dom";

export class MyForm extends React.Component<{}, { formId: string }> {
    protected onSubmit: any = (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>, store: FormStore) => {
        console.log("Submitting...");
        console.log(store.ToObject());
    };

    render() {
        return <Form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
            <label>
                Full name:
                <Text name="FullName" />
            </label>
            <label>
                Email:
                <Text name="Email" />
            </label>
            <Submit>Submit</Submit>
        </Form>;
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyForm />, document.getElementById("react-root"));
```

When rendered, it's a plain form:

And even html rendered is as plain as it can be:

It's not "like" a `plain HTML form`. It IS a plain HTML form.

But when filled and submitted, it prints this into console:

Can you see it already? :smile:

Declarative form with an intuitive, almost default `onSubmit`, where getting an object of the whole form boils down to this:
```ts
store.ToObject()
```

The only difference from the "default" `onSubmit` is that you get `FormStore` as a second parameter into the handler. And that is only for your convenience. You can take it in a few different ways, if you want.

And what `FormStore` gives you is simplicity. The `ToObject()` method takes care of knowing how to transform data in the store into a plain object. You don't have to take care of any refs, values, nothing. Name your fields with.. Well, `name`. And you're good to go!

Easy? Super easy!

### That's amazing? But... Where's everything else?

This simple example shows what works e2e at this very moment, but even here, quite a lot of things are handled behind the scenes:
* Form is registered with `FormStoresHandler` and `FormStore` is initiated.
* `formId` is not given, therefore it is generated automatically for you.
* Both `text` fields are registered with the same store with the same generated `formId` and you didn't have to do anything!
* `Submit` button used here is from `simplr-forms-dom`, but no custom logic is being used in this example. It's basically your default `<button type="submit">Submit</button>` and it could be one. Because effectively this one is, as you can see in the HTML shown above :+1: No custom click handlers, nothing. Plain button of type `submit`.
* Everything behind the scenes updates data in the `FormStore` for you and you can already listen to actions coming from `FormStore` and do what you need accordingly.

Also, I'm pretty sure `Modifiers` and `Normalizers` would work already, but did not test that yet.
`Validators` with `simplr-validation` package also do what they are supposed to do (kudos to [Martynas](https://twitter.com/MartiogalaLT) for that one).

Oh, riiight. Since the last post almost two weeks ago, [Martynas](https://twitter.com/MartiogalaLT) has already finished an initial version of `simplr-validation` and we will test it out soon and make the forms ready for it.

### So the validation is tightly coupled with forms and not externalized...

No! Well, yes, but no! :smile:

It is coupled only by a public API that `simplr-forms-core` exposes and that's it.

You already can create your own validation library and just use the same public API and you're good to go!

Why am I so sure? Because, `simplr-validation` does just that.

### Awesome. What's next?

Until we can ship a solid alpha, we need to have:
* Most commonly used HTML components covered in `simplr-forms-dom`.
* Modifiers and Normalizers working.
* Validation working with `simplr-forms-dom`.

Until we can ship a solid beta, we need to have:
* All HTML components covered in `simplr-forms-dom`.
* Reliably working `FieldsGroup`.

As soon as we have something solid, we will ask a few people to test it out. And for the mean time, yay for a first e2e flow!
