### Sooooo... What happened?

After quite a bit of work, a first e2e workflow now forks. Non-test, but a working browser example! 

### So... How does it look?

Technical. No styles, no nothing, just two text fields and a form. And you can submit it (this one is big for the library :smile:).

### And if we spoke code?

Right. So the exciting part is that everything works as planned:

A declarative and intuitive way to build forms.

The whole react application including the forms looks like this:
```ts
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "tslib";
import { FormStore } from "simplr-forms-core/stores";
import { Form, Text, Submit } from "simplr-forms-dom";

export class MyForm extends React.Component<{}, { formId: string }> {
    protected onSubmit: any = (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>, store: FormStore) => {
        console.log("Submitting...");
        console.log(store.ToObject());
    };

    render() {
        return <Form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
            <label>
                Full name:
                <Text name="FullName" />
            </label>
            <label>
                Email:
                <Text name="Email" />
            </label>
            <Submit>Submit</Submit>
        </Form>;
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyForm />, document.getElementById("react-root"));
```

When rendered, it's a plain form:


And now... It's coding time again! :tada:
