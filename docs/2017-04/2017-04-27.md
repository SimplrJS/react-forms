### What's new?

`Modifiers` and `Normalizers` work properly with fields!

### Soooo... What are those?

Let's start with `Normalizers`. If you ever needed to make sure your input is all lower-case, upper-case or alphanumeric, think how would you approach that scenario.

Now look at this. I introduce to you: `Normalizers`.

Imagine you need a form for a promo code. It has a few limitations: it's upper-case and alphanumeric characters only.

You could let user enter whatever input and then take what's needed, stripping all spaces and symbols away.

But that is not user friendly, because user cannot see what's happening behind the scenes and their imput is being modifier without any visual feedback.

You could also take `onChange` event and enforce required rules there, setting the value to the filtered one after each key stroke.
But the logic gets messy and it's an imperative approach to solve this problem.

What if you could take this familiar form application (yep, that's the whole application, if you didn't read [the last post](https://github.com/SimplrJS/simplr-forms/blob/master/docs/2017-04/2017-04-26.md)):
```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "tslib";
import { FormStore } from "simplr-forms-core/stores";
import { Form, Text, Submit } from "simplr-forms-dom";

export class Main extends React.Component<{}, { formId: string }> {
    protected onSubmit: any = (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>, store: FormStore) => {
        console.log("Submitting...");
        console.log(store.ToObject());
    };

    render() {
        return <Form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
            <label>
                Promo code:
                <Text name="PromoCode" />
            </label>
            <Submit>Submit</Submit>
        </Form>;
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Main />, document.getElementById("react-root"));
```

And declare required rules well... In a declarative fashion?

E.g. for upper-case, you import an `UpperCaseNormalizer` like this:
```ts
import { UpperCaseNormalizer } from "simplr-forms-core/normalizers";
```
And declare the rule right inside the field like this:
```tsx
<Form>
    <label>
        Promo code:
        <Text name="PromoCode">
            <UpperCaseNormalizer />
        </Text>
    </label>
    <Submit>Submit</Submit>
</Form>
```

Convenient, right? Now you think that the `UpperCaseNormalizer` is some complex peace of code, right?

Well, decide for yourself, because the whole `UpperCaseNormalizer` looks like this:
```ts
import { BaseNormalizer } from "simplr-forms-core/normalizers";
import { FieldValue } from "simplr-forms-core/contracts";
import { ValueOfType } from "simplr-forms-core/utils";

export class UpperCaseNormalizer extends BaseNormalizer<{}, {}> {
    Normalize(value: FieldValue): FieldValue {
        if (ValueOfType<string>(value, UpperCaseNormalizer.name, "string")) {
            return value.toUpperCase();
        }
    }
}
```

Library imports are organized and easily reachable.

And what is `ValueOfType` thingy there?

That's just a convenient helper function that checks if `typeof value === "string"` and throws an error with a proper message if it's not. Take it or leave it. The library is not opinionated about that.

There's more.

We only have our value normalized to upper-case now. What about alphanumeric part?

Well, you can compose `Normalizers` and even decide the order of them as you wish, all still declaratively, like this:
```tsx
<Form>
    <label>
        Promo code:
        <Text name="PromoCode">
            <UpperCaseNormalizer />
            <AlphanumericNormalizer />
        </Text>
    </label>
    <Submit>Submit</Submit>
</Form>
```

Now value will be upper-cased and all non-alphanumeric symbols filtered out. If you think that upper-casing should go after alphanumeric filter, you just change the order, still declaratively:
```tsx
<Form>
    <label>
        Promo code:
        <Text name="PromoCode">
            <AlphanumericNormalizer />
            <UpperCaseNormalizer />
        </Text>
    </label>
    <Submit>Submit</Submit>
</Form>
```

Want something more?

`Normalizers` are regular react components, therefore, they can take props. E.g.:
```tsx
<AlphanumericNormalizer allowSpaces={true} />
```
Now you can unleash the power of declarative rule listing and composition and use props for an easy control of `Normalizers` behaviour.

When user is typing `discount123`, this is how it looks in the field (also, in the store):

`Normalizers` enforced all declared rules.

This is how you easily organize and reuse your normalization logic.

### Amazing! What about `Modifiers`?

`Modifiers` are another convenient feature. You use them just as you used `Normalizers`: declare inside the field.

But what they do is a bit different: `Modifiers` format and parse value of the field.

To be more specific:
* When value comes from `FormStore` to the field, it is formatted.
* When it changes, before going to `FormStore`, it is parsed.

This enables you to have a `numeric` value in the store and a `string` one in the field. Or storing `Date` in the store and formatting it for user in a human-readable format.

And `Normalizers` get an already parsed value, so you don't have to care about converting it to the right type in the `Normalizers` and it's the only thing you do in `Modifier`. [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) :+1:

Example of `Modifier` usage:
```tsx
<Form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
    <label>
        Full name:
        <Text name="FullName">
            <NumericModifier />
        </Text>
    </label>
    <Submit>Submit</Submit>
</Form>
```

And you can also use both `Modifiers` and `Normalizers` in the same `Field`:
```tsx
<Form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
    <label>
        Full name:
        <Text name="FullName">
            <NumericModifier />
            <UpperCaseNormalizer />
        </Text>
    </label>
    <Submit>Submit</Submit>
</Form>
```
Even if this case does not make much sense (numeric->upper-case), I'm sure someone will find a proper usage.

### What's next?

Weâ€™ll look at `Reset` and `Clear` buttons, how they work and what are they used for. We'll learn how `initialValue` and `defaultValue` can be used in a meaningful way.
