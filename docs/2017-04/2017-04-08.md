### Why do we need yet another forms library?

Over the past few years we worked with React, we tried **MANY** form libraries that are out there.

#### Problems with existing libraries

* There is no de-facto standard library for forms in React, like there is for routing ([react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router))
* They all have their limitations and usually big ones
* Performance is usually bottlenecking as the project grows
* No really flux friendly
* There are not a single library that is build **in the React way**

Ok, so the big one is the libraries can never be consumed in a **React** way, which raises a whole bunch of other problems:
* You have to learn everything from the ground up to use the library
* When you write your app in a declarative react way, you have to fallback to imperative or semi-imperative way for forms
* Library has to reinvent the wheel to *do things*
* Lifecycle management becomes hell on earth
* Race conditions appear out of the blue

I could go on here, but [Michael Jackson](https://github.com/mjackson) said it better [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vur2dAFZ4GE)
and the problems are more than apparent.

#### So why do we start now?

Well, technically, we started almost a year ago (Jan 12, 2016) by building a simplr-forms v0.0.4 and used it internally.
v1.0.0 was also released internally on May 30, 2016.
v2.0.0 as well, released internally on September 7th, 2016.
We introduced v3.0.0-beta in Dec 7, 2016. And we made all possible mistakes during these 3 versions.
We had 113 different alphas, betas, RCs and stable ones in between.

And more than a year later, we still don't see a proper library for forms out there. This is why we are putting the efforts into
spec'ing, architecting and building the library out there in public.
